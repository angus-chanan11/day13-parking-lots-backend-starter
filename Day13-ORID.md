In my previous use of genAI, I have never used them to help generate this large amount of code. Most of the times, I only use it as auto-completion. This is due to the past unpleasant experience of getting fake info or wrong codes when using genAI. But it seems that the current genAI, with detailed prompt can actually generate useful codes.

I would use more genAI in my future work. I have seen how much it could boost my productivity in writing codes.
